# DataWarehouseProject-AKEI 
A fake project to fulfill university final task requirements and implement my understanding of data warehouse ("Implementasi Data Warehouse Menggunakan Pentaho pada Perusahaan AEKI yang Bergerak Dibidang Furniture")

## Background
AEKI is one of Indonesia's largest furniture manufacturing companies, generating a substantial amount of data related to sales, customer information, and more. However, AEKI faces limitations in data management, hindering effective decision-making for the company's growth. Therefore, the goal of this research is to provide solutions to AEKI's challenges through the design and implementation of a data warehouse. A data warehouse plays a crucial role by analyzing data to support business information needs. To achieve business intelligence, the implementation process will be facilitated using open-source software, specifically Pentaho Data Integration (PDI). PDI aids in the extraction, cleansing, and storage of data to ensure integration. The data warehouse provides accessibility for the company to analyze data, facilitating accurate and credible decision-making. AEKI anticipates that the implementation of the data warehouse will enhance performance and achieve strategic targets for the company. The ultimate objective of the data warehouse is to attain business intelligence, providing insights into all challenges faced by AEKI.

## Objectives
- Data Warehouse Implementation: Design and implement a data warehouse to address AEKI's data management challenges.
- Business Intelligence Integration: Achieve business intelligence through the utilization of Pentaho Data Integration for data extraction, cleansing, and storage.
- Improved Decision-Making: Enhance decision-making capabilities by providing easy access to integrated and analyzed data.
- Performance Enhancement: Improve performance and achieve strategic targets through effective data analysis.

## Methodology
1. ETL Process: Develop Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes to transfer data from source systems to the data warehouse, ensuring data accuracy and consistency.
2. Data Warehouse Design: Develop a comprehensive data warehouse architecture tailored to AEKI's specific data requirements.
3. Star Schema Creation: Design and implement a star schema for the data warehouse, providing a structured and efficient way to organize data for analysis.
4. Pentaho Data Integration (PDI): Utilize PDI to facilitate the implementation process, ensuring efficient data extraction, cleansing, and integration.
5. Data Analysis and Integration: Implement processes to analyze and integrate AEKI's data, making it accessible for decision-making.
6. Performance Evaluation: Evaluate the impact of the data warehouse implementation on AEKI's performance and strategic goals.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the implementation of a data warehouse is vital for supporting business intelligence in a company like AEKI. Through business intelligence, AEKI can measure and evaluate its business processes, providing a competitive advantage in determining strategic policies and achieving targeted goals. The data at AEKI is now cleaner, confirmed, and integrated, facilitating the analysis of AEKI's sales over the past year, revealing relatively high and stable sales levels.

## Tools Utilized:
- Pentaho Spoon: Utilized for the visual design of ETL processes, making data integration and transformation more efficient.
- H2 Database: Employed as the backend database for the data warehouse, offering a lightweight and scalable solution.
- Schema Workbench: Used for designing and managing the star schema, ensuring optimal organization of data for analysis.
